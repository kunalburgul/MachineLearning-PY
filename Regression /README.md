## **Regression**

Regression analysis is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a dependent and independent variable.

The above definition is a bookish definition, in simple terms the **regression** can be defined as, “Using the relationship between variables to find the best fit line or the regression equation that can be used to make predictions”.
