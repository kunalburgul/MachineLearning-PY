## **Classification**

Classification can be performed on structured or unstructured data. Classification is a technique where we categorize data into a given number of classes. The main goal of a classification problem is to identify the category/class to which a new data will fall under.

Few of the terminologies encountered in machine learning â€“ classification:

- Classifier: An algorithm that maps the input data to a specific category.
- Classification model: A classification model tries to draw some conclusion from the input values given for training. It will predict the class labels/categories for the new data.
- Feature: A feature is an individual measurable property of a phenomenon being observed.
- Binary Classification: Classification task with two possible outcomes. Eg: Gender classification (Male / Female)
- Multi class classification: Classification with more than two classes. In multi class classification each sample is assigned to one and only one target label. Eg: An animal can be cat or dog but not both at the same time
- Multi label classification: Classification task where each sample is mapped to a set of target labels (more than one class). Eg: A news article can be about sports, a person, and location at the same time.
