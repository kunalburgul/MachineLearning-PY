- The above definition is a bookish definition, in simple terms the **regression** can be defined as, “Using the relationship between variables to find the best fit line or the regression equation that can be used to make predictions”.

- Regression is concerned with modeling the relationship between variables that is iteratively refined using a measure of error in the predictions made by the model.

- Regression methods are a workhorse of statistics and have been co-opted into statistical machine learning. This may be confusing because we can use regression to refer to the class of problem and the class of algorithm. Really, regression is a process.
