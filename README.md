# **Supervised Learning**

- This algorithm consist of a target / outcome variable (or dependent variable) which is to be predicted from a given set of predictors (independent variables). Using these set of variables, we generate a function that map inputs to desired outputs. The training process continues until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the training data. 

- Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn the mapping function that turns input variables (X) into the output variable (Y). In other words, it solves for f in the following equation:

             Y = f (X)

This allows us to accurately generate outputs when given new inputs.

We’ll talk about two types of supervised learning: classification and regression.

### **Regression** 

- it is used to predict the outcome of a given sample when the output variable is in the form of real values. For example, a regression model might process input data to predict the amount of rainfall, the height of a person, etc.

### **Classification** 

- It is used to predict the outcome of a given sample when the output variable is in the form of categories. A classification model might look at the input data and try to predict labels like “sick” or “healthy.”

# **Unsupervised Learning**

- In this algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict / estimate. It is used for clustering population in different groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention.

# **Reinforcement Learning**

- Using this algorithm, the machine is trained to make specific decisions. It works this way: the machine is exposed to an environment where it trains itself continually using trial and error. This machine learns from past experience and tries to capture the best possible knowledge to make accurate business decisions.
