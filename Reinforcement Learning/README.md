# **Reinforcement Learning**

- Using this algorithm, the machine is trained to make specific decisions. It works this way: the machine is exposed to an environment where it trains itself continually using trial and error. This machine learns from past experience and tries to capture the best possible knowledge to make accurate business decisions.

- Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning algorithm that allows an agent to decide the best next action based on its current state by learning behaviors that will maximize a reward.

- Reinforcement algorithms usually learn optimal actions through trial and error. Imagine, for example, a video game in which the player needs to move to certain places at certain times to earn points. A reinforcement algorithm playing that game would start by moving randomly but, over time through trial and error, it would learn where and when it needed to move the in-game character to maximize its point total.
