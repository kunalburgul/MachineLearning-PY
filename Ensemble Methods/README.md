## Ensemble Methods

- Ensembling means combining the results of multiple learners (classifiers) for improved results, by voting or averaging. Voting is used during classification and averaging is used during regression. The idea is that ensembles of learners perform better than single learners.

- There are 3 types of ensembling algorithms: Bagging, Boosting and Stacking.
