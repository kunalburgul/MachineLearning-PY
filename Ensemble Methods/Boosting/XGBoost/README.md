## XGBoost

Another classic gradient boosting algorithm thatâ€™s known to be the decisive choice between winning and losing in some Kaggle competitions.

The XGBoost has an immensely high predictive power which makes it the best choice for accuracy in events as it possesses both linear model and the tree learning algorithm, making the algorithm almost 10x faster than existing gradient booster techniques.

The support includes various objective functions, including regression, classification and ranking.

One of the most interesting things about the XGBoost is that it is also called a regularized boosting technique. This helps to reduce overfit modelling and has a massive support for a range of languages such as Scala, Java, R, Python, Julia and C++.

Supports distributed and widespread training on many machines that encompass GCE, AWS, Azure and Yarn clusters. XGBoost can also be integrated with Spark, Flink and other cloud dataflow systems with a built in cross validation at each iteration of the boosting process.
