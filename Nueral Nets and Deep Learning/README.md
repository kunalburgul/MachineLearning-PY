## **Neural Network** 

- Neural Networks are models that are inspired by the structure and/or function of biological neural networks.

- They are a class of pattern matching that are commonly used for regression and classification problems but are really an enormous subfield comprised of hundreds of algorithms and variations for all manner of problem types.

The most popular artificial neural network algorithms are:

Perceptron
Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)
Back-Propagation
Stochastic Gradient Descent
Hopfield Network
Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)


## **Deep Learning** 

- Deep Learning methods are a modern update to Artificial Neural Networks that exploit abundant cheap computation.

- They are concerned with building much larger and more complex neural networks and, as commented on above, many methods are concerned with very large datasets of labelled analog data, such as image, text. audio, and video.

The most popular deep learning algorithms are:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)
Stacked Auto-Encoders
Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM)
Deep Belief Networks (DBN)
