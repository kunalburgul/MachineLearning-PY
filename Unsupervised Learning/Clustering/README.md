## **Clustering**

- Clustering methods are typically organized by the modeling approaches such as centroid-based and hierarchal. All methods are concerned with using the inherent structures in the data to best organize the data into groups of maximum commonality.

- The most popular clustering algorithms are:

             k-Means
             k-Medians
             Expectation Maximisation (EM)
             Hierarchical Clustering
