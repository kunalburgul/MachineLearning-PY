# **Unsupervised Learning**

- In this algorithm, we do not have any target or outcome variable to predict / estimate. It is used for clustering population in different groups, which is widely used for segmenting customers in different groups for specific intervention.

- Unsupervised learning models are used when we only have the input variables (X) and no corresponding output variables. They use unlabeled training data to model the underlying structure of the data.

### **Pattern Serach or Association**

- It is used to discover the probability of the co-occurrence of items in a collection. It is extensively used in market-basket analysis. 

- For example, an association model might be used to discover that if a customer purchases bread, s/he is 80% likely to also purchase eggs.

### **Clustering** 

- Used to group samples such that objects within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to the objects from another cluster.

### **Dimensionality Reduction** 

- It is used to reduce the number of variables of a data set while ensuring that important information is still conveyed. Dimensionality Reduction can be done using Feature Extraction methods and Feature Selection methods. 

- Feature Selection selects a subset of the original variables. Feature Extraction performs data transformation from a high-dimensional space to a low-dimensional space. Example: PCA algorithm is a Feature Extraction approach.
